<h1 ALIGN="center"><a NAME="basics">2 - FLVW Basics</a></h1>

<p>This will give you the basics of using the Virtual Widgets.&nbsp; For most of
the conventions and programming guidelines see Chapter 2 of the FLTK
documentation entitled 2 - FLTK Basics.&nbsp; Only exceptions or differences
will be listed here.</p>
<h2>Naming</h2>
All public symbols in FLVW start with the characters 'Flv':
<h2>Compiling Programs with Standard Compilers</h2>
When compiling you should define FLTK_2 if compiling for 2.x cvs versions and
not define FLTK_2 if compiling for 1.x production versions.&nbsp;

<p>For the Borland ide projects you will need to set FLTK to point to the 1.x
FLTK directory and set FLTKCVS to point to the 2.x cvs FLTK directory.&nbsp; For
either version you should set BCROOT to point to the base Borland C++ directory.
</p>

<h2>Writing Your First Program with FLVW</h2>
You should include the widget header file for whichever widgets you will be
using.&nbsp; Listing 1 shows a very basic use of Flv_List.
<ul>

<p><i>Listing 1 - &quot;basiclist.cxx&quot;</i><br>
  &nbsp;</p>
  <pre>#include &lt;FL/Flv_List.H&gt;
#include &lt;FL/Fl_Window.H&gt;
#include &lt;FL/fl_draw.H&gt;

class My_Flv_List : public Flv_List
{
public:
  My_Flv_List(int X, int Y, int W, int H, const char *l=0 ) :
    Flv_List(X,Y,W,H,l) {};
  void draw_row( int R, int Offset, int X, int Y, int W, int H );
};

// These will be the 10 values we display in the list
char *values[] = {&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;9&quot;,&quot;10&quot; };

void My_Flv_List::draw_row( int R, int Offset, int X, int Y, int W, int H )
{
  Flv_Style s;

  get_style( R, s );       // Get trickled down row style

  // Do basic row drawing and set up for our text
  Flv_List::draw_row( R, Offset, X, Y, W, H );

  // Draw our list values
  fl_draw(values[R], X+1-Offset, Y+1, W-2, H-2, s.align() );
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Fl_Window *w = new Fl_Window( 200, 200, &quot;Basic List&quot; );
  My_Flv_List *l = new My_Flv_List( 10, 10, 180, 180 );

  w-&gt;resizable(l);            // List resizable
  l-&gt;rows(10);                // List has 10 rows
  l-&gt;has_scrollbar(VERTICAL); // Automatic vertical scroll bar

  w-&gt;show(argc, argv);        // Show main window
  return Fl::run();     // Run program
}
</pre>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img src="images/basicwin.png"></p>

<p>After including the required header files, the program defines a class,
implements a draw row and then in main creates a window with widgets and displays it:&nbsp;
We will not touch much on main since it is covered much better in the FLTK
documentation.</p>

<p>First we inherit from Flv_List so we can define a function to draw the list
row.&nbsp; Since the classes are virtual they don't know (or want to know) how
you will be storing the values.&nbsp; This was a basic design decision so you
won't have to change the way you want to write a program to accommodate the
widgets.&nbsp; The class definition is basically just copied from a header
file.&nbsp; Let's look at the draw function you need to override:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><pre>
  Flv_Style s;

  get_style( R, s );       // Get trickled down row style
</pre></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We make a call to get_style so that we can get the trickle down version of
the row style for this row.&nbsp; A trickle down style starts with the
default style then adds any definitions from the global_style and then anything
defined in row_style[R] (if row_style[R] actually exists)&nbsp; All this is so
we can get an alignment style.&nbsp; For the
simple example we could have easily just assumed what our alignment should be
and used it.&nbsp; In that case our function would look like:</p>
<blockquote>
  
<p><kbd>&nbsp; Flv_List::draw_row( R, Offset, X, Y, W, H );<br>
  &nbsp; fl_draw(values[R], X+1-Offset, Y+1, W-2, H-2, FL_ALIGN_CLIP );<br>
  </kbd></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason I didn't do this in the original example, is it's generally a bad idea.&nbsp; You should get in
the habit of using the styles.&nbsp; Then when you use them in code, they'll
work.&nbsp; That being said, just two lines of code and our text will always print centered!&nbsp; This
is truely the simplest it gets. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> The program is mostly a basic FLTK
program, if you've written an FLTK program before there shouldn't be any
supprises here.&nbsp; We create a window, a table, set some table properties,
show the window and run the program.&nbsp; If you need further assistance with
the main program loop see the FLTK documentation.</p>

<p>As a general practice you should define styles from lower values to higher
values (indices) where possible.&nbsp; This will ensure minimal overhead and the
classes are specifically optimized for this condition.</p>
