    <P>
    Features, as used by these widgets, affect the way the widget looks and/or
    feels.  Most features have a visible effect.  Multiple features may be
    manipulated by or'ing values together.  For instance:
    (FLVF_ROW_HEADER | FLVF_ROW_DIVIDER).  Features are manipulated by one of
    four functions:
    <UL>
      <LI>feature - which will set the features to a specific group.</LI>
      <LI>feadure_add - which will add new features without affecting exisiting
        ones.</LI>
      <LI>feature_remove - which will remove a set of features without affecting other
        features.</LI>
      <LI>feature_test - which will determine if a enitre set of features
        are defined.</LI>
    </UL>
    For example:<BR>
    <P><TT>feature(FLVF_MULTI_SELECT | FLVF_ROW_HEADER )</TT><BR>
    Will set the multi select and row header features while turning off all
    other features.</P>

    <P><TT>feature_add(FLVF_MULTI_SELECT | FLVF_ROW_HEADER )</TT><BR>
    Will add multi select and row header features to the existing features.</P>

    <P><TT>feature_remove(FLVF_MULTI_SELECT | FLVF_ROW_HEADER )</TT><BR>
    Will remove multi select and row header features while leaving any other
    set features as is.</P>

    <P><TT>feature_test(FLVF_MULTI_SELECT | FLVF_ROW_HEADER )</TT><BR>
    Will test if both multi select and row header features are on.  It will
    return true only if both are on.
