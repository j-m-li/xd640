    <P>
    Scroll bars appear at the right and bottom of the widget if visible.  They
    are used to reveal portions of the widget not currently visible.  The
    vertical scroll bar departs somewhat from traditional scroll bars by
    actually moving the selection bar.

    </UL>

    <H4>FLVS_ALWAYS</H4>
    <UL>
