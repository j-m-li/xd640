# By default use a Un*x-style shell
#
# uncomment next line to use NT command shell 
# SHELL=cmd.exe
#
# or uncomment next line to explicitly use a unix-compatible shell
# SHELL=sh.exe
#
# If we are using a Un*x-based make, make sure the environmental var is set
# set MAKE_MODE=unix
#
# By default, a Un*x style make is assumed, so towards the bottom of this
# file filenames are copied with 'cp' and use forward slashes throughout
# in filepaths.
#
# Changing to a Windows-based command line would require 'cp' replaced with
# a local equivalent ('copy' is OK) and potentially for forward-slashes in
# filepaths to be replaced by back-slashes.
