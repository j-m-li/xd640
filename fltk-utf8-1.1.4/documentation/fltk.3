       fltk - the fast light tool kit


SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       The Fast Light Tool Kit ("FLTK", pronounced "fulltick") is
       a C++ graphical user interface toolkit for  the  X  Window
       System,  MacOS(r),  and Microsoft Windows(r) that supports
       OpenGL(r).   It  was  originally  developed  by  Mr.  Bill
       Spitzak  and  is  currently maintained by a small group of
       developers across the world with a central  repository  in
       the US.

       FLTK  is  provides under the terms of the GNU Library Gen-
       eral Public License, with the following exceptions:

              1. Modifications to the FLTK configure script, con-
              fig  header  file,  and  makefiles by themselves to
              support a specific platform  do  not  constitute  a
              modified or derivative work.

              The  authors  do request that such modifications be
              contributed to the FLTK project - send all  contri-
              butions to "fltk-bugs@fltk.org".

              2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do
              not constitute a derivative work.

              3. Static linking of applications  and  widgets  to
              the  FLTK  library does not constitute a derivative
              work and does not require  the  author  to  provide
              source  code for the application or widget, use the
              shared FLTK libraries, or link  their  applications
              or widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.

              If you link the application or widget to a modified
              version  of  FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be
              provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections 1,
              2, and 4.

              4.  You  do  not have to provide a copy of the FLTK
              license with programs that are linked to  the  FLTK
              library,  nor  do  you  have  to  identify the FLTK
              license  in  your  program  or   documentation   as
              required by section 6 of the LGPL.

              However,  programs must still identify their use of
              FLTK.  The  following  example  statement  can   be
              included  in  user  documentation  to  satisfy this
              requirement:

              [program/widget] is based in part on  the  work  of
              the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).
